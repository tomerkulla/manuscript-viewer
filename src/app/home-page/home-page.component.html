            <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: left;">The Manuscript Processor project team consists of scientists from signal processing, computer science, science of history, and linguistics. The diversity inside this group ensures that the different needs of the involved areas of expertise are respected during the whole development process. <br> The core of the Manuscript Processor system consists of an easy-to-use historical document processing tool chain that allows to process digitized historical documents, and to perform search queries on them. The system is not only intended to be used by historians, librarians, scholars as well as ordinary people.  Librarians can use it to assign metadata to scanned manuscripts or to annotate and transcribe the content. It allows historians to systematically process and index historical manuscripts. Besides dealing with handwritten documents, it allows to store, share and collaborate on handling these documents online. <br> It implements an easy-to-use web-based graphical user interface (GUI) which is user-friendly and easy to handle after a short training period.</p>
